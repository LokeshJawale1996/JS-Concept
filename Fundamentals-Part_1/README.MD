1)Data Types
 i)string
 ii)Number
 iii)Bollean
 iv)null
 v)undefined
 vi)Symbol
 vii)BigInt
 

2)Variables- let,var & const
var -function scope
let & const - block scoped (accessible within that block)
const- it's value cannot be modified


3)Basics Operators
 i)Math operator(/ * + -)
 ii)Assignment operator(+= -+ *= /= x++ x-- ++x --x)
 iii)Comparision Operator(< > <= >=)

4)Operator Precedence

5)Strings and Template Literals
 i)string literal is a sequence of characters from the source character set enclosed in double quotation marks (" ")
 ii)Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.


6)If/else statements
in this we check the condition of if (if it is trur if block will be executed otherwise else block will be executed)

7)Type Conversion and Coercion
Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference â€” type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.


8)Truthy and Falsy Values
There are 5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN

9)Equaility Operators == && === (Loose Equals & Tight equals)
i) ( == ) operator: is also known as loose equality operator which is mainly used to compare two value on both the sides and then return true or false.
ii) ( === ) operator: checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

10)Logical Operators(&& || !)
 i) && - only true if all statements are  true otherwise false
 ii) || - true if any one statment is true otherwise false
 iii) ! - acting reversly if !(true) then results false and if !(false) then result true


11)Switch Statement

12)The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

    let age = 15;
    const isReadyForVote = age >=18 ? console.log("eligible for voting") : console.log("not eligible for voting")
